= I've installed and activated the plugin but my Videojug url still shows as a link rather than an embedded video? =

1. Head over to the video page of the desired video on Videojug
2. Press on the button "embed"
3. Press on Edit Options
    - You can decide the measurements of the video by editing the Height and Width. Just input the desired measurements and the code automatically updates to your desired measurements. By default this is 640 by 382 pixels
    - You can change the embed code format to a standard format by ticking the tick box that says "Standard Embed Codes". The embed code is an iFrame by default. Revert back to an iFrame embed code by unticking the box.
